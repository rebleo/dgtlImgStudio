#### Bulletin Description: 
This capstone course allows students in the Digital Imaging minor to work independently on a variety of their digital imaging projects. Under the guidance of the instructor, each student designs and realizes one or more substantial projects during the course of the semester. Students must have substantial skills, both technically and aesthetically, in the field of digital imaging prior to enrolling in this course.

#### Detailed Description:
This course allows students working at an advanced level of digital imaging to work independently on a variety of projects of their own choosing. There will be weekly assignments for the first few weeks. Then students will develop and realize two substantial imaging projects during the course of the semester. The weekly class meetings entai critique, works in progress, technical demonstrations + exercises, instructor lectures and student research presentations.


There will be an emphasis on the technicalities of high-quality digital printing of physical prints. Assignments will explore different digital image making techniques: making images with code, with a lens, digital illustration etc.

Students have access to the small DDA Printing Lab on the fifth floor of Myrtle Hall, the large [Digital Output Center](https://www.pratt.edu/academics/technology-resources/computer-labs-brooklyn/digital-output-center/) of the Institute in the Engineering building + the Imaging Center in the Design Building.

#### Course Goals:
A primary goal of the course is to provide students an opportunity to continue the development of the their artwork in an atmosphere of independence and inquiry. In the process, to also: improve their understanding of what constitutes effective digital imaging in today's world, improve their awareness of the historical and theoretical contexts in which their work resides, and ensure that students are comfortable with the techniques and issues of contemporary digital imaging.

#### Course Requirements:
##### Attendance:
It is extremely important that you attend all classes. Please note also that it is Pratt Institute policy that three unexcused absences constitute grounds for an automatic F for the course, and that two latenesses are considered the equivalent of one absence. Arriving more than 10 minutes after the scheduled start of class will be considered late. Arriving more than one hour after the scheduled start time will be considered absent. Students are responsible for their own attendance and must allow for delays due to subways, traffic, etc. If you miss class because of illness, you should bring in a note from your physician or the Pratt Student Health center to avoid your absence being listed as “unexcused".

If you miss a session, you are responsible for finding out what you missed and making it up.

##### Imaging Assignments:
For the first few weeks of the semester, students will complete weekly conceptual assignments while exploring different technical aspects of digital imaging. During this time, students are required to bring at least three different printed images to class every week for critique.

In addition to smaller weekly assignments - students will work on two four week-long projects. The second project may be an extension of the first if both student and instructor feel it appropriate. In all cases, projects should be of a complexity and sophistication to warrant the amount of time devoted to them. Some suggested possibilities for students to consider for their projects are: a series of fine-art prints; combining digital and traditional imaging techniques; single or multiple channel video; installations; book art; interactive or web-based works.

##### Reading:
Readings will be assigned semi-weekly and can be accessed from the class site. 

##### Course Machines:
Mobile devices are strictly prohibited during class time (unless you are using a tablet to take notes). There will be a zero tolerance policy regarding the use of any software that does not relate to course material during class time. The misuse of networked technologies will negatively impact your performance in this course.

##### Research Presentation & Paper:
Students will make one short research presentation to the class on an issue relevant to their art practice and of interest to them. Topics will be chosen by the student in consultation with the instructor. Presentations should be about 10 minutes + include a consciously curated slide deck. The in class presentation will be accompanied by a short paper prepared by each student.

##### Course Materials:
* You are required to have the following for this class. You should have everything by the second week. 
* A Github Account - we will set this up day one
* An external hard drive - at least 1 terabyte
Sheet photo paper. We will talk about this in class. 
* White cotton gloves - for handling large rolls of paper

##### Course Websites:
Students are required to maintain a class site for this course using Github Pages, keeping their posts up to date with current thoughts, responses to class material, research, technical tests + works in progress. The site should consist of original writing, links to research and images when appropriate. This site will serve as a record of your progress + can be a valuable asset to you in the future. In the second week of class, students will learn the basics of web development + [Github](http://www.github.com) account.

##### “Share” (or the class wiki):
The class wiki - is where weekly assignments + resources can be found. I may ask you to turn in written assignments via the wiki. You should add a link to your work using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

#### [Course Outline (this will likely change)](outline.md)

#### Assessment + Grading:
Grading will be based on the originality, visual sophistication, conceptual depth, technical skill, and timely completion of projects.

The weighting of grades for this course is as follows:
Participation			20%
Regular Assignments		30%
Research Presentation 		10%
Projects 1 + 2			40%

All assignments must be handed in on the due date. If you have not finished your work or as much as you had intended, you should hand in whatever you have finished up to that point. Your work will be graded based on whatever portion you have handed in as of the due date. It is your responsibility to schedule your time and your work to allow ample time for technical troubleshooting. Remember, when working with technology estimate how long a task will take, then multiple that number by three.

Pratt's official guidelines for Grading.

Given that graduate students must keep an overall GPA of 3.0 (B), this can be interpreted as follows:
Extremely good work						A Very good work							A- Good work, better than average					B+ Reasonably good, but not outstanding				B OK, somewhat short of satisfactory				B- Slightly better than minimally passing, not acceptable quality	C+ Minimally passing, not acceptable quality			C

At the graduate level, grades below C are considered non-passing.
